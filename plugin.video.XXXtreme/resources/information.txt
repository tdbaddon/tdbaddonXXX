[COLOR deeppink]XXX-O-DUS Information[/COLOR]

[COLOR red]The addon contains features that you should be aware of:

[B]1) History Monitoring[/B][/COLOR]
	[COLOR white]History monitoring is disabled by default. It can be enabled from the settings of the addon.[/COLOR]

[COLOR red][B]2) Downloadable Videos[/B][/COLOR]
	[COLOR white]All videos within the addon are downloadable. You can select the location to download the addon and watch them from the My Downloads section of the main menu.[/COLOR]

[COLOR red][B]3) Favourites[/B][/COLOR]
	[COLOR white]The addon contains many scrapers that in total will pull hundreds of thousands of videos. Should you find a video  you like you can add it to the favourites by clicking Add To Favourites on the prompt before watching any video.[/COLOR]

[COLOR red][B]4) Parental Controls[/B][/COLOR]
	[COLOR white]We know how sensitive this type of material can be. For this reason we have included parental controls within the addon. These controls can only be accessed from within the addon (not the settings dialog) this is to ensure that should anyone wish to disable the controls they will first need to log in with the code. In addition to this the code is encoded when stored so even if someone got the code it would be useless to them without decoding it.[/COLOR]
