[COLOR white]Having the repository installed is vital as it allows us to push updates to the addon. Without the repository you will end up with an outdated version of the addon and when things break it will be very hard for support to be provided.

You can get the ECHO XXX repository by addon the following source to your Kodi file manager.[/COLOR]
